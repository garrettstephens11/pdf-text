# PDF Reader with Poppler and Flask

This application utilizes the Poppler library and Flask to create a web-based PDF reader. The application allows users to upload a PDF file and then displays the content of the uploaded file in a simple and clean interface.

The Poppler library, which is written in C, provides a powerful and efficient backend for our application. By taking advantage of the speed and performance of C, this app delivers a fast and responsive user experience.

This application was created with guidance from ChatGPT-4, an artificial intelligence language model developed by OpenAI.
